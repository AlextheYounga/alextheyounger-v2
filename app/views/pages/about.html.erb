        <p>I became a Zipline Tour Guide at Historic Banning Mills during high school. Ironically I was afraid of heights when
          I first started; I just needed a job. Little did I know that this job would shape me into a good-willed, respectable,
          and continually improving human being. I worked there for nearly five years.</p>

        <p>Like many students, I was pressured into going to college right out of high school. I attended Georgia Highlands College
          with the intent of transferring to UGA, in pursuit of an economics degree. I didn't finish, not
          because of grades, but because after two years I was told that I was advised incorrectly on what classes to take.
          The college claimed I needed another year to complete a two year degree. This simply confirmed what I
          already suspected: that college is mostly a scam and largely a waste of time. <b>I learned no marketable skills here, and I
            wish I had never attended college.</b></p>

          connects driven, entrepreneurial-minded kids with startup companies to learn business skills through an
          apprenticeship. Only 1% of applicants are accepted into the program, and luckily I passed. It was a great choice for me
          because I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, and a startup is a place where I could wear many hats.
          The program taught me, and continues to teach me, self-marketing skills and crucial business skills.
          Companies like this are going to reinvent the education industry.</p>
