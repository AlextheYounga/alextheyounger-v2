        <p>I became a Zipline Tour Guide at Historic Banning Mills during high school. Ironically I was afraid of heights when
          I first started; I just needed a job. Little did I know that this job would shape me into a good-willed, respectable,
          and continually improving human being. I worked there for nearly five years.</p>

        <div class="pin-r pin-t absolute p-3 text-red-lightest bg-red-darkest inline-block">Sep 2014 - 2016</div>
        <p>Like many students, I was pressured into going to college right out of high school. All I knew was that I loved economics, so I pursued for an econ degree, not
          even knowing how I could ever make any money with it. I attended Georgia Highlands College, a small community college
          with the intent of transferring to UGA after two years. I didn't finish, not
          because of grades, but because after two years I was told that I was advised incorrectly on what classes to take.
          The college claimed I needed another year to complete a two year degree. This simply confirmed what I
          already suspected: that college is mostly a scam and largely a waste of time. <b>I learned no marketable skills here, and I
            wish I had never attended college in the first place.</b></p>

        <p><a class="no-underline burgandy hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="discoverpraxis.com">Praxis</a> is an organization that
          connects driven, entrepreneurial-minded kids with startup companies to learn business skills through an
          apprenticeship. Only 1% of applicants are accepted into the program, and luckily I passed. It was a great choice for me
          because I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, and a startup is a place where I could wear many hats.
          The program taught me, and continues to teach me, self-marketing skills and crucial business skills.
          Companies like this are going to reinvent the education industry.</p>

            <i>The CEO Tightrope</i></a>, and agreed with his philosophy completely; I told Praxis that I absolutely wanted to work for Joel.
          I wore many hats at Khorus, but my main role was in marketing. I always found myself migrating to programming and I even modified an <a

        <p>I'm very grateful for my internship at Khorus, however, when the internship ended, Joel simply didn't have the resources to keep me on as a full employee. So
          sadly, I was unemployed for about 4 months in a city I had just moved to, which is an experience I would never wish on anyone. Living on my savings and ham
          sandwiches I devoted most of my time to learning Ruby on Rails. I refused to go home a failure and I was sick of Texas; I managed to snag another zipline job in
          Colorado: the place I'd always wanted to live. I used the last 2 grand I had in savings to move there. I arrived more or less with nothing, but I'll never
          regret that decision.</p>

        <p>I spent the next 6 months living in Ca√±on City working as a zipline tour guide, working with seriously some of the best people I've ever met in my life. The
          most appealing aspect about outdoor jobs like these are the people who work them; they're irreplaceable. There's nothing like guiding a tour all day through the
          mountains and then rock climbing with coworkers on Shelf Road, (one of the best rock climbing spots in the state). But in all other moments of spare time, I was
          programming, trying to build a portfolio.</p>

          work at half the rate you would normally pay. If I prove myself, hire me on as an employee. If I can't prove my value to your company after 30 days, please let
          me go." The rest is history. I have been working with <a href="https://www.izoox.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
